One possible approach to test automation is to adopt a framework that supports behavior-driven development (BDD) or test-driven development (TDD) principles. 
This involves writing tests in a natural language format that closely aligns with the business requirements or user stories. 
By utilizing a tool like Cucumber or SpecFlow, test cases can be defined in a readable and understandable manner, making it easier for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to collaborate. 
This approach promotes clear communication and ensures that the tests focus on the desired behavior of the system, leading to more effective and maintainable automated tests.
Introducing a new testing framework or methodology, such as a continuous testing framework like Jenkins or CircleCI, can enhance test automation practices by enabling automated testing throughout the software development lifecycle and promoting faster feedback loops. 
Adopting a shift-left testing approach, such as BDD or agile testing, can foster early collaboration and improve test coverage, resulting in higher product quality and customer satisfaction.
