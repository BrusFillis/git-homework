One possible approach to test automation is to adopt a framework that supports behavior-driven development (BDD) or test-driven development (TDD) principles. 
This involves writing tests in a natural language format that closely aligns with the business requirements or user stories. 
By utilizing a tool like Cucumber or SpecFlow, test cases can be defined in a readable and understandable manner, making it easier for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to collaborate. 
This approach promotes clear communication and ensures that the tests focus on the desired behavior of the system, leading to more effective and maintainable automated tests.
