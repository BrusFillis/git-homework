One possible approach to test automation is to adopt a framework that supports behavior-driven development (BDD) or test-driven development (TDD) principles. 
This involves writing tests in a natural language format that closely aligns with the business requirements or user stories. 
By utilizing a tool like Cucumber or SpecFlow, test cases can be defined in a readable and understandable manner, making it easier for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to collaborate. 
This approach promotes clear communication and ensures that the tests focus on the desired behavior of the system, leading to more effective and maintainable automated tests.
Furthermore, incorporating automation testing in the software development lifecycle can significantly reduce the time and effort required for regression testing, allowing for faster feedback on system changes and enabling continuous integration and delivery. As a result, teams can achieve quicker release cycles and improved overall software quality.
